{"title":"Pasta With Butternut Squash and Sage Brown Butter","description":"Brown butter-based pasta sauces are some of the simplest things around.

{"title":"Ricotta Gnocchi With Asparagus and Prosciutto","description":"Fresh ricotta gnocchi may be the fastest fresh-pasta recipe I know. With a little practice, I've gotten it down to under ten minutes (8 minutes 53 seconds, to be precise). But the great part about this recipe is that it serves as a suitable base for a huge variety of sauces and flavors.
